## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, 
and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. A US bike-sharing provider has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.


## Conclusions
Your task involves creating a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes using the provided independent variables. This model will serve as a tool for management to gain insight into how demand fluctuates based on various features. With this information, they can adjust the business strategy to align with demand levels and fulfill customer expectations. Additionally, the model will offer valuable insights into the demand patterns of a new market.
